GPTQ is a one-shot weight quantization method based on approximate second-order information(Hessian). The bit-width is reduced to 3-4 bits per weight. Extreme experiments on 2-bit and ternary quantization are also provided. <br />#PTQ #3-bit #4-bit #2-bit |

In General, weights are easier to quantize than activation. It propose to migrate the quantization difficulty from activations to weights using mathematically equivalent transformation using $`s = \frac{\left( \max \left( \lvert X \rvert \right) \right)^\alpha}{\left( \max \left( \lvert W \rvert \right) \right)^{1-\alpha}}`$.<br />#PTQ #W8A8 |

The motivation is protecting only 1% of sliant weighs can retain the performance. Then, AWQ aims to search for the optimal per-channel scaling $`s^* = \arg\min_{s} \left\Vert Q \left( W \cdot \text{diag}(s) \right) \left( \text{diag}(s)^{-1} \cdot X \right) - W X \right\Vert`$ to protect the salient weights by observing the activation. Then, we have $Q(w\cdot s)\cdot \frac{x}{s}$.<br />#PTQ #W4A16 |

BitDistiller (1) incorporates a tailored asymmetric quantization and clipping technique to perserve the fidelity of quantized weight and (2) proposes a Confidence-Aware Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CAKLD) as self-distillation loss. Experiments involve 3-bit and 2-bit configuration. <br />#QAT #2-bit #3-bit #KD |

For the salient weights, they propose the binary residual approximation strategy. For the unsalient weights, they propose an optimal splitting search to group and binarize them independently.

Specifically, Silm-LLM involves two techniques: (1) Salience-Determined Bit Allocation (SBA): by minimizing the KL divergence between original output and the quantized output, the objective is to find the best bit assignment for each group. (2) Salience-Weighted Quantizer Calibration: by considering the element-wise salience within the group, Slim-LLM search for the calibration parameter $\gamma$ to prevent the degradation of local salient weight information in each group.<br />#MixedPrecision #2-bit |
| Arxiv24<br>[AdpQ:A Zero-shot Calibration Free Adaptive Post Training Quantization Method for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13358v1) | ![image-20240603205727796](https://github.com/pprp/Awesome-LLM-Quantization/blob/main/asset/image-20240603205727796.png) | This paper formulates outlier weight identification problem in PTQ as the concept of shinkage in statistical ML. By applying Adaptive LASSO regression model, AdpQ ensures the quantized weights distirbution is close to that of origin, thus eliminating the requirement of calibration data. Lasso Regression employ the L1 regularization and minimize the KL divergence between the original weight and quantized one. The experiments mainly focus on 3/4 bit quantization<br />#PTQ #Regression |

It is a fine-grained quantization method and can be used plug-and-play. Specifically, it reorder the sequence of costly type conversion I32toF32. <br />#PTQ #W4A16 #W4A8 |

QuaRot rotates the LLMs to remove the outliers from hideenstate. It apply randomized Hadamard transformations to the weight matrices without changing the model. When applying this transformation to attention module, it enables the KV cache quantization.  <br />#PTQ #4bit #Rotation |
| Arxiv24<br />[SpinQuant:LLM Quantization with Learned Rotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16406v2)<br />Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao etc. | ![image-20240603214042270](https://github.com/pprp/Awesome-LLM-Quantization/blob/main/asset/image-20240603214042270.png) | Rotating activation or weight matrices heps remove outliers and benefits quantizaion (rotational invariance property). They first identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer. They find that soem **random rotations lead to better quantization** than others. Then, SpinQuant was proposed to optimize the rotation matrices with *Cayley* optimization on validation dataset. Specifically, them employ Cayley SGD method to optimize the rotation matrix on the Stiefel manifold. <br />#PTQ #Rotation #4bit |
| NeurIPS2024 <br /> [Outliers and Calibration Sets have Dimishing Effect on Quantization of Mordern LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20835v1)<br /> Davide Paglieri, Saurabh Dash, Tim Rocktaschel, Jack Parker-Holder | ![image-20240604110208446](asset/image-20240604110208446.png) | This paper evaluates the effects of calibration set on the performance of LLM quantization, especially on hidden activations. Calibration set can distort the quantization range and negatively impact performance. This paper reveals that different model has shown different tendency towards quantization. (1) OPT has shown high susceptibility to outliers with varying calibration sets. (2) Newer models like Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B has demonstrated stronger robustness. This findings suggest a shift in PTQ strategies. These findings indicate that we should emphasis more on optimizing inference speed rather than focusing on outlier preservation. <br />#Analysis #Evaluation #Finding |

The experiments involves OPT, LLaMA and ViT. Findings: (1) sparsity and quantization are not orthogonal; (2) interaction between Sparsity and quantization significantly harm the performance, where quantization error is playing a dominant role in the degradation. <br />#Theory #Sparisty |
