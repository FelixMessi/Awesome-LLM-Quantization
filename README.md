# Awesome-LLM-Quantization

Welcome to the Awesome-LLM-Quantization repository! This is a curated list of resources related to quantization techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs). Quantization is a crucial step in deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones or edge devices, by reducing the model's size and computational requirements.

## Contents

This repository contains the following sections:

- **Papers**: A collection of research papers and articles on quantization techniques for LLMs.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides and tutorials for implementing quantization methods.
- **Libraries**: A list of open-source libraries and frameworks that support quantization for LLMs.
- **Datasets**: Datasets commonly used for benchmarking and evaluating quantized LLMs.
- **Tools**: Useful tools and utilities for quantization and deployment of LLMs.
